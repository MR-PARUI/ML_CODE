# Paper-Work
The paper compares four tree-based classifiers- Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost and 
XGBoost using the different train-test split on two publicly available German and Australian 
datasets. The purpose of this research is to give insight into bagging and boosting strategies for credit risk assessment and to compare with other standalone methods. As per the result, Bagging based Random Forest outperforms all the other classifiers in both the datasets.
